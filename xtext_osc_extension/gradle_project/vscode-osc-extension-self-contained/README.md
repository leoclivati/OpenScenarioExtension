# ASAM OpenSCENARIO Language Extension

## Overview

The ASAM OpenSCENARIO Language Extension is a Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extension designed to provide support for the ASAM OpenSCENARIO format. This extension aims to improve the workflow of developers working with OpenSCENARIO files by providing syntax highlighting, auto-completion, validation, and other helpful features to facilitate easier scenario development and debugging.

OpenSCENARIO is an ASAM (Association for Standardization of Automation and Measuring Systems) standard for defining driving scenarios for testing autonomous vehicles or advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS).

## Features
- Syntax Highlighting: Enables colorized display of OpenSCENARIO files (.osc), making it easier to read and edit the code.
- Auto-Completion: Provides code suggestions for standard OpenSCENARIO tags and attributes to help write scenarios faster and with fewer errors.
- Validation: Checks for syntax and schema errors in OpenSCENARIO files, alerting the user to potential issues.
- Bracket Matching: Highlights matching brackets to simplify the editing of nested structures.
